# gocloud

Opinionated package of wrapper, helper and utility functions for working with `gocloud.dev` packages.

## Documentation

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/aaronland/gocloud.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aaronland/gocloud)

Documentation remains incomplete. Documentation, such as it is, can be found in the individual sub-packages.

## Motivation

This is an pinionated package of wrapper, helper and utility functions for working with `gocloud.dev` packages. It is NOT comprehensive and instead reflects those services which occupy my time or have done so in the past. This is also NOT a "framework". It is a collection of packages and methods designed with "composability" in mind.

It is the merging of a number of other `aaronland/gocloud-SERVICE` packages.
